# My thoughts on the 2020 Election and Alleged Fraud.

I believe there is fraud in the 2020 Election. How did Biden a very weak man who is rarely seen get more votes than Obama?  
Perhaps Biden Won, but there is definitely at least some fraud in this Election and I won't accept Biden as the rightfully elected President until any fraud that happened is uncovered and he is still the winner.  
Texas and now 11 other states are suing battle ground states in the Supreme court as they had many irregularities in their elections that could effect the entire Presidential Election. Also with COVID-19 the amount of Main-In-Voting was crazy and that is something that would be very easy to cheat with, another issue with Mail-In-Voting is that it was done around a month before the election, before many allegations against Biden and his son Hunter Biden came out, after that Web Searches for "Can I change my vote" skyrocketed and many states don't allow it.
