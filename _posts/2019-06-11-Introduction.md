# Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am Reuben Talbott. This is a summery of my life since I was born.
I was born in 2003 and I lived with my parents in an apartment behind the Cary Cookout. A year later my sister AnneMarie was born and shortly after we moved to 1241 Hillington way. While at Hillington Way I gained 5 more siblings, and Mom started homeschooling my sister and I. In 2007 Dad founded [Spreedly](https://www.spreedly.com) after some very hard work it started growing. In 2015 the Talbott moved to a bigger house in Fuquay Varina since our family had swollen to 9 people and our house was getting a little cramped. In Fuquay Varina I have gained one last sweet sister, her name is Tilly and she is now 2 1/2 years old. In January of 2019 I passed the class room portion of Drivers Ed, a month later I passed the behind the wheel part of Drivers Ed. I now hold a level 1 drivers permit. I usually drive a 15 passenger Ford Transit. So if you see a 2016 Ford Transit van with magnetic neon __Driver in Training Please be Patient__ signs their is a high probability I am at the wheel  (At least until my sister gets her permit)
