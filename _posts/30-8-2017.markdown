So let me summarize what has happened so far on our road trip to Oregon.
We drove for 6 days about 6 hours each day, on Wednesday in the middle of this big drive we stopped to hike one of the mountains in the Rockies, the scenery was AWESOME!
Also on Friday we went to one of the salt lakes, I was able to float on my back without doing anything!
Then at Saturday we finally arrived in Oregon at Aunt Anna's and Uncle Daniel and stayed for a day and a half. On Sunday we went to church with Aunt Anna and Uncle Daniel.
That night we went to the cabin that Dad had rented, it was a two and a half hour drive, and because it was 10.30 when we arrived most of the kids fell asleep. The house was awesome and even had too many beds for all of us!

Well I am going to end that here for now.
